 To see what light we receive from Nature to direct our Actions, and how far we are Naturally able to obey that Light; Men must be consider'd purely as in the state of Nature, _viz._ as having no extrinsick Law to direct them, but indu'd only with a faculty of comparing their distant Ideas by intermediate Ones, and Thence of deducing, or infering one thing from another; whereby our Knowledge immediately received from _Sense_, or _Reflection_, is inlarg'd to a view of Truths remote, or future, in an Application of which Faculty of the mind to a consideration of our own Existence and Nature, together with the beauty and order of the Universe, so far as it falls under our view, we may come to the knowledge of a _First Cause_; and that this must be an _Intelligent Being, Wise_ and _Powerful_, beyond what we are able to conceive. And as we delight in our selves, and receive pleasure from the objects which surround us, sufficient to indear to us the possession and injoyment of Life, we cannot from thence but infer, that this _Wise_ and _Powerful Being_ is also most _Good_, since he has made us out of nothing to give us a Being wherein we find such Happiness, as makes us very unwilling to part therewith. 

 Which attentive consideration of the Works of God objected to our view, implies an exercise thereupon of that Faculty in us by which we deduce, or infer, one thing from another: Whence (as has been said) our knowledge immediately deriv'd to us from sensation, or reflection, is inlarg'd by the perception of remote, or distant Truths. The more obviously eminent advantages accruing to us from which faculty of reason, plainly make known the Superiority of its Nature; and that its suggestions, ought to be hearken'd to by us preferably to those of Sense; where these (as it too often happens) do not concur. For did we know nothing by _Inference_ and _Deduction_, both our knowledge and injoyment would be very short of what they now are; many considerable pleasures depending almost intirely upon Reason; and there being none of the greatest Enjoyments of Sense which would not lose their best Relish, separated from those concomitant satisfactions which accompany them only as we are rational Creatures. Neither is it our greatest happiness alone which is manifestly provided for in our being indu'd with this Faculty; but our much greater safety, and preservation likewise; since _these_ require a capacity in us of foreseeing distant Events, and directing means to an End, oftentimes through a long train of Actions; which is what we can only do by that in us, whereby the Relations, Dependencies and Consequences of things are discoverable to us.

 These philosophers profess to eschew all theory, and yet they only oppose theory to theory.  The assertion that reality for the human mind is restricted to the positive facts of the sensible order, is purely theoretic, and is any thing but a positive fact. Principles are as really objects of science as facts, and it is only in the light of principles that facts themselves are intelligible.  If the human mind had no science of reality that transcends the sensible order, or the positive fact, it could have no science at all.  As things exist only in their principles or causes, so can they be known only in their principles and causes; for things can be known only as they are, or as they really exist.  The science that pretends to deduce principles from particular facts, or to rise from the fact by way of reasoning to an order that transcends facts, and in which facts have their origin, is undoubtedly chimerical, and as against that the positivists are unquestionably right.  But to maintain that man has no intelligence of any thing beyond the fact, no intuition or intellectual apprehension of its principle or cause, is equally chimerical.  The human mind cannot have all science, but it has real science as far as it goes, and real science is the knowledge of things as they are, not as they are not. Sensible facts are not intelligible by themselves, because they do not exist by themselves; and if the human mind could not penetrate beyond the individual fact, beyond the mimetic to the methexic, or transcendental principle, copied or imitated by the individual fact, it could never know the fact itself.  The error of modern philosophers, or philosopherlings, is in supposing the principle is deduced or inferred from the fact, and in denying that the human mind has direct and immediate intuition of it.

 He turned to the rest of the targets. Time was getting short. He extracted every conceivable bit of information out of what his detectors told him. He checked each fragment for resonant frequencies, getting an idea of the size and shape of each. He checked the radiated infrared spectrum. He checked the decrement of the reflected radar pulse. Each scrap of information was an indication about the identity of the fragments. With frequent glances at the clock, constantly reminding him of how rapidly his time was running out, he checked and cross-checked the data coming in to him. Fighting to keep his mind calm and his thoughts clear, he deduced, inferred, and decided. One fragment after another, he sorted, discarded, rejected, eliminated, excluded. Until the screen was empty. 

 I had two literary men staying with me a week ago, both of them accomplished writers, and interested in their art, not professionally and technically only, but ardently and enthusiastically. I here label them respectively Musgrave and Herries. Musgrave is a veteran writer, a man of fifty, who makes a considerable income by writing, and has succeeded in many departments--biography, criticism, poetry, essay-writing; he lacks, however, the creative and imaginative gift; his observation is acute, and his humour considerable; but he cannot infer and deduce; he cannot carry a situation further than he can see it. Herries on the other hand is a much younger man, with an interest in human beings that is emotional rather than spectacular; while Musgrave is interested mainly in the present, Herries lives in the past or the future. Musgrave sees what people do and how they behave, while Herries is for ever thinking how they must have behaved to produce their present conditions, or how they would be likely to act under different conditions. Musgrave's one object is to discover what he calls the truth; Herries thrives and battens upon illusions. Musgrave is fond of the details of life, loves food and drink, conviviality and social engagements, new people and unfamiliar places--Herries is quite indifferent to the garniture of life, lives in great personal discomfort, dislikes mixed assemblies and chatter, and has a fastidious dislike of the present, whatever it is, from a sense that possibilities are so much richer than performances. Musgrave admits that he has been more successful as a writer than he deserves; Herries is likely, I think, to disappoint the hopes of his friends, and will not do justice to his extraordinary gifts, from a certain dreaminess and lack of vitality. Musgrave loves the act of writing, and is always full to the brim of matter. Herries dislikes composition, and is yet drawn to it by a sense of fearful responsibility. Neither have, fortunately, the least artistic jealousy. Herries regards a man like Musgrave with a sort of incredulous stupefaction, as a stream of inexplicable volume. Herries has to Musgrave all the interest of a very delicate and beautiful type, whose fastidiousness he can almost envy. As a rule, literary men will not discuss their art among themselves; they have generally arrived at a sort of method of their own, which may not be ideal, but which is the best practical solution for themselves, and they would rather not be disquieted about it; literary talk, too, tends to partake of the nature of shop, and busy men, as a rule, like to talk the shop of their recreations rather than the shop of their employment. But Musgrave will discuss anything; and as for Herries, writing is not an occupation, so much as a divine vocation which he regards with a holy awe.

 The Selfish Net � The Semantic Web By: Sam Vaknin A decade after the invention of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee is  promoting the "Semantic Web". The Internet hitherto is a repository of  digital content. It has a rudimentary inventory system and very crude data  location services. As a sad result, most of the content is invisible and  inaccessible. Moreover, the Internet manipulates strings of symbols, not  logical or semantic propositions. In other words, the Net compares values  but does not know the meaning of the values it thus manipulates. It is  unable to interpret strings, to infer new facts, to deduce, induce, derive,  or otherwise comprehend what it is doing. In short, it does not understand  language. Run an ambiguous term by any search engine and these shortcomings  become painfully evident. This lack of understanding of the semantic  foundations of its raw material (data, information) prevent applications  and databases from sharing resources and feeding each other. The Internet  is discrete, not continuous. It resembles an archipelago, with users  hopping from island to island in a frantic search for relevancy. Even visionaries like Berners-Lee do not contemplate an "intelligent Web".  They are simply proposing to let users, content creators,  and web  developers assign descriptive meta-tags ("name of hotel") to fields, or to  strings of symbols ("Hilton"). These meta-tags (arranged in semantic and  relational "ontologies" - lists of metatags, their meanings and how they  relate to each other) will be read by various applications and allow them  to process the associated strings of symbols correctly (place the word  "Hilton" in your address book under "hotels"). This will make information  retrieval more efficient and reliable and the information retrieved is  bound to be more relevant and amenable to higher level processing  (statistics, the development of heuristic rules, etc.). The shift is from  HTML (whose tags are concerned with visual appearances and content  indexing) to languages such as the DARPA Agent Markup Language, OIL  (Ontology Inference Layer or Ontology Interchange Language), or even XML  (whose tags are concerned with content taxonomy, document structure, and  semantics). This would bring the Internet closer to the classic library  card catalogue. Even in its current, pre-semantic, hyperlink-dependent, phase, the Internet  brings to mind Richard Dawkins' seminal work "The Selfish Gene" (OUP,  1976). This would be doubly true for the Semantic Web. Dawkins suggested to generalize the principle of natural selection to a law  of the survival of the stable. "A stable thing is a collection of atoms  which is permanent enough or common enough to deserve a name". He then  proceeded to describe the emergence of "Replicators" - molecules which  created copies of themselves. The Replicators that survived in the  competition for scarce raw materials were characterized by high longevity,  fecundity, and copying-fidelity. Replicators (now known as "genes")  constructed "survival machines" (organisms) to shield them from the  vagaries of an ever-harsher environment. This is very reminiscent of the Internet. The "stable things" are HTML  coded web pages. They are replicators - they create copies of themselves  every time their "web address" (URL) is clicked. The HTML coding of a web  page can be thought of as "genetic material". It contains all the  information needed to reproduce the page. And, exactly as in nature, the  higher the longevity, fecundity (measured in links to the web page from  other web sites), and copying-fidelity of the HTML code - the higher its  chances to survive (as a web page). Replicator molecules (DNA) and replicator HTML have one thing in common -  they are both packaged information. In the appropriate context (the right  biochemical "soup" in the case of DNA, the right software application in  the case of HTML code) - this information generates a "survival machine"  (organism, or a web page).  The Semantic Web will only increase the longevity, fecundity, and copyingfidelity or the underlying code (in this case, OIL or XML instead of HTML).  By facilitating many more interactions with many other web pages and  databases - the underlying "replicator" code will ensure the "survival" of  "its" web page (=its survival machine). In this analogy, the web page's  "DNA" (its OIL or XML code) contains "single genes" (semantic meta-tags).  The whole process of life is the unfolding of a kind of Semantic Web. In a prophetic paragraph, Dawkins described the Internet: "The first thing to grasp about a modern replicator is that it is highly  gregarious. A survival machine is a vehicle containing not just one gene  but many thousands. The manufacture of a body is a cooperative venture of  such intricacy that it is almost impossible to disentangle the contribution  of one gene from that of another. A given gene will have many different  effects on quite different parts of the body. A given part of the body will  be influenced by many genes and the effect of any one gene depends on  interaction with many others...In terms of the analogy, any given page of  the plans makes reference to many different parts of the building; and each  page makes sense only in terms of cross-reference to numerous other pages" What Dawkins neglected in his important work is the concept of the Network.  People congregate in cities, mate, and reproduce, thus providing genes with  new "survival machines". But Dawkins himself suggested that the new  Replicator is the "meme" - an idea, belief, technique, technology, work of  art, or bit of information. Memes use human brains as "survival machines"  and they hop from brain to brain and across time and space  ("communications") in the process of cultural (as distinct from biological)  evolution. The Internet is a latter day meme-hopping playground. But, more  importantly, it is a Network. Genes move from one container to another  through a linear, serial, tedious process which involves prolonged periods  of one on one gene shuffling ("sex") and gestation. Memes use networks.  Their propagation is, therefore, parallel, fast, and all-pervasive. The  Internet is a manifestation of the growing predominance of memes over  genes. And the Semantic Web may be to the Internet what Artificial  Intelligence is to classic computing. We may be on the threshold of a selfaware Web. 

 The Selfish Net - The Semantic Web By: Sam Vaknin A decade after the invention of the World Wide Web, Tim  Berners-Lee is promoting the "Semantic Web". The Internet  hitherto is a repository of digital content. It has a  rudimentary inventory system and very crude data location  services. As a sad result, most of the content is invisible  and inaccessible. Moreover, the Internet manipulates strings  of symbols, not logical or semantic propositions. In other  words, the Net compares values but does not know the meaning  of the values it thus manipulates. It is unable to interpret  strings, to infer new facts, to deduce, induce, derive, or  otherwise comprehend what it is doing. In short, it does not  understand language. Run an ambiguous term by any search  engine and these shortcomings become painfully evident. This  lack of understanding of the semantic foundations of its raw  material (data, information) prevent applications and  databases from sharing resources and feeding each other. The  Internet is discrete, not continuous. It resembles an  archipelago, with users hopping from island to island in a  frantic search for relevancy. Even visionaries like Berners-Lee do not contemplate an  "intelligent Web". They are simply proposing to let users,  content creators,  and web developers assign descriptive metatags ("name of hotel") to fields, or to strings of symbols  ("Hilton"). These meta-tags (arranged in semantic and  relational "ontologies" - lists of metatags, their meanings  and how they relate to each other) will be read by various  applications and allow them to process the associated strings  of symbols correctly (place the word "Hilton" in your address  book under "hotels"). This will make information retrieval  more efficient and reliable and the information retrieved is  bound to be more relevant and amenable to higher level  processing (statistics, the development of heuristic rules,  etc.). The shift is from HTML (whose tags are concerned with  visual appearances and content indexing) to languages such as  the DARPA Agent Markup Language, OIL (Ontology Inference Layer  or Ontology Interchange Language), or even XML (whose tags are  concerned with content taxonomy, document structure, and  semantics). This would bring the Internet closer to the  classic library card catalogue. Even in its current, pre-semantic, hyperlink-dependent, phase,  the Internet brings to mind Richard Dawkins' seminal work "The  Selfish Gene" (OUP, 1976). This would be doubly true for the  Semantic Web. Dawkins suggested to generalize the principle of natural  selection to a law of the survival of the stable. "A stable  thing is a collection of atoms which is permanent enough or  common enough to deserve a name". He then proceeded to  describe the emergence of "Replicators" - molecules which  created copies of themselves. The Replicators that survived in  the competition for scarce raw materials were characterized by  high longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity. Replicators  (now known as "genes") constructed "survival machines"  (organisms) to shield them from the vagaries of an everharsher environment. This is very reminiscent of the Internet. The "stable things"  are HTML coded web pages. They are replicators - they create  copies of themselves every time their "web address" (URL) is  clicked. The HTML coding of a web page can be thought of as  "genetic material". It contains all the information needed to  reproduce the page. And, exactly as in nature, the higher the  longevity, fecundity (measured in links to the web page from  other web sites), and copying-fidelity of the HTML code - the  higher its chances to survive (as a web page). Replicator molecules (DNA) and replicator HTML have one thing  in common - they are both packaged information. In the  appropriate context (the right biochemical "soup" in the case  of DNA, the right software application in the case of HTML  code) - this information generates a "survival machine"  (organism, or a web page).  The Semantic Web will only increase the longevity, fecundity,  and copying-fidelity or the underlying code (in this case, OIL  or XML instead of HTML). By facilitating many more  interactions with many other web pages and databases - the  underlying "replicator" code will ensure the "survival" of  "its" web page (=its survival machine).

 These philosophers profess to eschew all theory, and yet they only oppose theory to theory.  The assertion that reality for the human mind is restricted to the positive facts of the sensible order, is purely theoretic, and is any thing but a positive fact. Principles are as really objects of science as facts, and it is only in the light of principles that facts themselves are intelligible.  If the human mind had no science of reality that transcends the sensible order, or the positive fact, it could have no science at all.  As things exist only in their principles or causes, so can they be known only in their principles and causes; for things can be known only as they are, or as they really exist.  The science that pretends to deduce principles from particular facts, or to rise from the fact by way of reasoning to an order that transcends facts, and in which facts have their origin, is undoubtedly chimerical, and as against that the positivists are unquestionably right.  But to maintain that man has no intelligence of any thing beyond the fact, no intuition or intellectual apprehension of its principle or cause, is equally chimerical.  The human mind cannot have all science, but it has real science as far as it goes, and real science is the knowledge of things as they are, not as they are not. Sensible facts are not intelligible by themselves, because they do not exist by themselves; and if the human mind could not penetrate beyond the individual fact, beyond the mimetic to the methexic, or transcendental principle, copied or imitated by the individual fact, it could never know the fact itself.  The error of modern philosophers, or philosopherlings, is in supposing the principle is deduced or inferred from the fact, and in denying that the human mind has direct and immediate intuition of it. 

 I had two literary men staying with me a week ago, both of them accomplished writers, and interested in their art, not professionally and technically only, but ardently and enthusiastically. I here label them respectively Musgrave and Herries. Musgrave is a veteran writer, a man of fifty, who makes a considerable income by writing, and has succeeded in many departments--biography, criticism, poetry, essay-writing; he lacks, however, the creative and imaginative gift; his observation is acute, and his humour considerable; but he cannot infer and deduce; he cannot carry a situation further than he can see it. Herries on the other hand is a much younger man, with an interest in human beings that is emotional rather than spectacular; while Musgrave is interested mainly in the present, Herries lives in the past or the future. Musgrave sees what people do and how they behave, while Herries is for ever thinking how they must have behaved to produce their present conditions, or how they would be likely to act under different conditions. Musgrave's one object is to discover what he calls the truth; Herries thrives and battens upon illusions. Musgrave is fond of the details of life, loves food and drink, conviviality and social engagements, new people and unfamiliar places--Herries is quite indifferent to the garniture of life, lives in great personal discomfort, dislikes mixed assemblies and chatter, and has a fastidious dislike of the present, whatever it is, from a sense that possibilities are so much richer than performances. Musgrave admits that he has been more successful as a writer than he deserves; Herries is likely, I think, to disappoint the hopes of his friends, and will not do justice to his extraordinary gifts, from a certain dreaminess and lack of vitality. Musgrave loves the act of writing, and is always full to the brim of matter. Herries dislikes composition, and is yet drawn to it by a sense of fearful responsibility. Neither have, fortunately, the least artistic jealousy. Herries regards a man like Musgrave with a sort of incredulous stupefaction, as a stream of inexplicable volume. Herries has to Musgrave all the interest of a very delicate and beautiful type, whose fastidiousness he can almost envy. As a rule, literary men will not discuss their art among themselves; they have generally arrived at a sort of method of their own, which may not be ideal, but which is the best practical solution for themselves, and they would rather not be disquieted about it; literary talk, too, tends to partake of the nature of shop, and busy men, as a rule, like to talk the shop of their recreations rather than the shop of their employment. But Musgrave will discuss anything; and as for Herries, writing is not an occupation, so much as a divine vocation which he regards with a holy awe.

 "But I don't understand that," Lee protested; "she has never had any serious trouble with her heart before." He was halted by Daniel's brief peculiar scrutiny. The doctor replied that this was not organic. "It may be the result of unaccustomed and excessive heat; an accumulation of the excessive," he added concisely. "Excesses." The single word followed after a hesitation in which Fancett was plainly at a loss. His frowning gaze was still bent upon Lee. "I know so little of Mrs. Randon's history," he finally said. Daniel naturally had inferred, or perhaps the doctor deduced, that Savina and he were married. They would be, in a very short while, Lee told himself stubbornly. "You have ice on the batey? Yes, at once, please. And a nurse can come from my office on the Havana train this evening." Daniel nodded once, in acknowledgment. He moved closer to Lee:
